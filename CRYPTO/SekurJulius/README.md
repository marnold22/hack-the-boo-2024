Description: Hidden deep in the forest was an ancient scroll, rumored to grant immense power to anyone who could read its shifting symbols. On Halloween, a curious traveler found the scroll, its letters strangely out of order. As they deciphered the message, the words slowly rearranged themselves, revealing a dark spell. But with the final shift, the traveler felt a cold presence behind them, whispering, 'You were never meant to understand.' The forest grew silent, but the spell was already cast.
