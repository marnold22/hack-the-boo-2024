Description: For years, strange signals pulsed through the air on the eve of October 31st. Some said it was the voice of an ancient witch, others believed it was a message from something far darker. A cryptic message, scattered in three parts, was intercepted by a daring group of villagers. Legend spoke of a deal made between the witch and a shadowy figure, but the true intent of their secret could only be revealed by those brave enough to decipher it before midnight, when the veil between worlds would thin.
