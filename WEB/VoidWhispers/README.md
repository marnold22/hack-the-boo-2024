Description: In the dead of night, an eerie silence envelops the town, broken only by the faintest of echoesâ€”whispers in the void. A phantom mailer is sending out silent commands, unseen and unheard, manipulating systems from the shadows. The townsfolk remain oblivious to the invisible puppeteer pulling their strings. Legends hint that sending the right silent message back could reveal hidden secrets. Can you tap into the darkness, craft the perfect unseen command, and shut down the malevolent force before it plunges the world into chaos?
